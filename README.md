 In this repository, a  program  to  implement  a  simple  games  system  with  points  and  a leaderboard was created. The two games created were coin flip and rock,paper scissors. 
 
The program works as follows:
1.  Begin with a main menu that allows the user to choose to start as a new player or quit.
2.  If the user chooses to start as a new player, the program prompts the user to enter a name for the player, and then allows the player to choose which game to play.  
3.  After playing the game, the user can choose to play a different game or to finish playing and return to the main menu.  
4.  At the main menu, if the user chooses to quit, the program displays a list of all players who have played, sorted by their points totals.
